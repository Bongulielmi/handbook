# Comake Core Values

## Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the "best", because "best" means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

## Capable initiative

Be a go getter. If you see something that needs doing, do it. If you find an opportunity, go after it. Don't wait for someone to always tell you what to do. If you think it is a decision that requires approval, go get approval and then follow through with whatever is decided. Improve your skills and capabilities and expand comfort zones as you pursue opportunities.

## Openness, humility, and transparency

Pushing the boundaries of discovery means being wrong a lot. It's important to be ok with being wrong. It's more important to be open and transparent about being wrong. However, trying to hide flaws and errors (even if they are other people's) is not tolerated as it will inevatibly lead to bigger problems. Always be respectful when discussing problems and mistakes.

## Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their  perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

## Health and happiness

A happy and healthy workplace is a competitive advantage. Please take care of your mental, physical, and spiritual well being and help encourage your colleagues to do the same.

## Contextual intelligence

By default, assume that there are many right answers to any given problem. Your perceived right answer may not be the only one or the best one. Be open to other points of view, other backgrounds, other truths. Try to understand the broader and even different contexts before moving forward. 

## Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.

## We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction on teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.
