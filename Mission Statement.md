# Mission Statement

## Our mission is to help people better understand and contextualize their reality, starting with work.

We help people and businesses better manage the large amounts of fragmented data they interact with across a variety of systems and services. Comake offers contextual intelligence as a service, which augments users' decision making through improved contextual understanding of a situation. We strive to provide useful information passively and in a way that is least intrusive or disruptive, allowing users to have an authentic and personal relationship with the technology they use. We can point this intelligence at a variety of business problems, starting with productivity and collaboration, and later growing into governance, security, and more. Our core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our product.
